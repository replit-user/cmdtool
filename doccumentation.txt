this program is a simple note taker using a cli or command line interface, this is an example of a program without a gui, what this program does is take 2-3 command line arguments from the user and based off of that makes a text file, for example, this text file was made with this program!, if your text has spaces make sure to sorround it in double quotes, the program uses 2 positional arguments and an option -a or --append flag that adds to the end of a file rather then overwriting it, the first argument is filename usually being *.txt but can also be *.py *.cpp etc, so this is pretty much all the documentation of this script,it even automatically makes new lines for txt files, so pretty useful, you can use a period (.) followed by an n to make a new line I haven't implemented .t yet but I'll get around to it...hopefully, but yeah this is the description of this note taking program I made, as previously mentioned there is no gui and because of that linux users will flock to this tool (IM JOKING) but yeah have a good day and thanks for reading this
